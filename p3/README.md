##The Legend of Frogger

This is my project 3, to run the game, download all files, and open index.html
in a web browser. Use the arrow keys to move around. No attack button just yet!

* Level 1 Objective:
get to the stone block

* Level 2 Objective:
get to the top most right block and press up

Avoid the water bugs! You would need to refresh the browser if you get to
the "game over" screen.
